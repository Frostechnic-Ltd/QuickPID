/********************************************************
   PID RelayOutput Example
   Same as basic example, except that this time, the output
   is going to a digital pin which (we presume) is controlling
   a relay.  the pid is designed to Output an analog value,
   but the relay can only be On/Off.

     to connect them together we use "time proportioning
   control"  it's essentially a really slow version of PWM.
   first we decide on a window size (5000mS say.) we then
   set the pid to adjust its output between 0 and that window
   size.  lastly, we add some logic that translates the PID
   output into "Relay On Time" with the remainder of the
   window being "Relay Off Time"
   The minWindow setting is a floor so that the relay would
   be on for a minimum amount of time.
